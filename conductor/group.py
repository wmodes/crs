"""Data elements for CRS.

Co-related Space is an interactive multimedia installation that engages the
themes of presence, interaction, and place. Using motion tracking, laser light
and a generative soundscape, it encourages interactions between participants,
visually and sonically transforming a regularly trafficked space. Co-related
Space highlights participants' active engagement and experimentation with sound
and light, including complex direct and indirect behavior and relationships.
