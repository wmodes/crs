"""Subclassed field class.

Co-related Space is an interactive multimedia installation that engages the
themes of presence, interaction, and place. Using motion tracking, laser light
and a generative soundscape, it encourages interactions between participants,
visually and sonically transforming a regularly trafficked space. Co-related
Space highlights participants' active engagement and experimentation with sound
and light, including complex direct and indirect behavior and relationships.

        A word about graphics scaling:

         * The laser DAC measures in uh, int16? -32,768 to 32,768
         * Pyglet measures in pixels at the screen resolution of the window you create
         * The pathfinding units are each some ratio of the smallest expected radius
